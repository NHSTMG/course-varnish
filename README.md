## Vagrant image

To start the Ubuntu 16.10 Vagrant instance, type:

```
vagrant up
```

You can shut it down again using:

```
vagrant halt
```

When the image is done downloading and booting, you can SSH into it like this:

```
vagrant ssh
```

If you want to start all over again, just destroy the vagrant instance:
```
vagrant destroy
```
